#Screenja

Efficient categorization of screenshots on OSX.

Screenja allows you to take screenshots on Mac OSX and right after that the screnshot is named with custom filename and also saved in custom folder (On your Desktop).
This allows you to take screenshots that you want later to use in documents, like reports, manuals, and so on...

It's up to you, what keyboard shortcut you want to use.
Maybe something like:  ⌘ + SHIFT + 5
